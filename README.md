# WeightInAnElevatorSimulation
A person of mass m is standing in an elevator of mass M. The person is standing on spring-weight with negligible mass and spring constant k. 
Find the force shown by the weight and the force in the wire if both the elevator and the person is moving with a constant acceleration a.
Discuss what really happens as the elevator starts moving from rest.
